I have started [soa-tr](http://soa-tr.com) in 2007 and tried to explain the bits and pieces of SOA with my every post since then. It has also been an amazing experience for me to see how SOA refined itself in time and became an acknowledged supporter of business and IT innovation. Surely, a lot of emerging technologies showed up since 2007, each promising better business and new opportunities, SOA always remained as the enabling force of business and IT alignment. Latest example being Gartner's [Nexus of Forces](http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=234840 "Nexus of Forces") and the need for a more open and proactive IT.

Below presentation is my attempt to create a pile of information on the most important concepts around SOA for the avid SOA learner.
