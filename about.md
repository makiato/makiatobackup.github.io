Mehmet Akyuz

I'm a Sydney based Digital Solutions Architect with 18+ years of technology experience and a shiny TOGAF certificate.

I have been helping clients from finance, insurance, telco and other industries with their large programs and managing end to end architectures. Lately I got more involved in digital transformation initiatives and sharing my thoughts and ideas in my blog.

I'm particularly interested in APIs, enterprise architecture and digital thinking.

I'm also fond of motorcycles , photography  and music  and occasionally code  for fun.
